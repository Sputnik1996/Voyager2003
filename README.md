# Archive

This repository contains datasheets, manuals, and specification PDF documents for each part used in my custom workstation build, as well as an Excel document I made to keep everything organized.

It is meant as a personal reference hub, a clean and organized place where I can quickly access all the information I might need during planning, mounting, and maintenance of the system.

## ðŸŒ± About This Project

This build represents a dream Iâ€™ve been nurturing, my first fully custom PC, created purely from passion and curiosity: *"The Voyager 2003"*.
Yes, I know I could have chosen way less expensive parts, but I want it to be the first and last I make for myself.

## ðŸ’¡ Contributing & Suggestions

Iâ€™m still learning as I go, gathering knowledge piece by piece, and documenting everything here both to stay organized and to share the journey with anyone who might be walking a similar path.

If you have ideas, advice, or see ways I could improve, youâ€™re warmly invited to **[open an Issue](../../issues)** and share your thoughts.

Your insight could make this build even better! Thanks in advance!
